## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why isn't my EPUB loading?
Make sure your EPUB file is not corrupted. Some EPUBs are image-based rather than text-based, which may cause loading issues.

### Can I change the background color?
Currently, DarkReader only supports the dark theme (black background with white text).

### Where are my books stored?
All books and reading progress are stored locally on your device. Nothing is uploaded to the cloud or shared externally.

### Can I organize books into folders?
Not yet! This feature is planned for a future update.

### Does DarkReader collect my data?
No! DarkReader does not collect, store, or share any personal data. Your privacy is our priority.
